# Claude Skills and Agents Test Framework

This experiment uses Claude Code with a simple [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) that asks
for basic Scala 3 related things.

Instead of feeding Claude with one task at a time, I asked it to implement the whole
[REQUIREMENTS](./REQUIREMENTS.md) on its own.

Its written in Scala 3 and built with SBT.

There are no corrections in this example, I wanted to have an example of what vibe coding
would produce.

See my observations [here](./LOG.md#observations).
