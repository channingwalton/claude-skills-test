## Observations

- Claude tried to use git history to cheat :D
- Began by asserting it will follow TDD principles
- Wrote an unnecessary test for Book
- Ran the test which didn't compile as expected
- Wrote the Book case class
- Ran the test which passed
- Committing!
- Continued to follow TDD loop
- Used case classes following FP principles
- Used proper return types for errors (`Either`)
- Eliminated duplication in search functions without prompting
- Loans caused more complexity than other solutions required with a Loan type
- Unnecessary code due to poor use of collections. eg. `Library.returnBook`
