### Add books to the library

Prompt: Use the XP skill to implement "Add books to the library" from REQUIREMENTS.md in the Scala project

Clarification requested: Should addBook allow duplicate books with the same ISBN?

I chose to reject duplicates.

The LibraryTest included some poor assertions so I needed to ask Claude to fix it.

## Observations

- Using FP
- Clarifying questions asked
- XP phases respected
- TDD respected
- Some tests were weak and needed my intervention
