Corrections: 2

## Observations

- Basic XP loop seems to work
- Had to correct a test: `assert(result.isLeft)` instead of proper assertion
- Correctly remembered to commit after my first correction, but I don't think it would remember in a different session
- It sometimes forgot a step (like refactor)
- Claude recognised impending duplication in the second search feature and asked for clarification on how to deal with it. Nice!
