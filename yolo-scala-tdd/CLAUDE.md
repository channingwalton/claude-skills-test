# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Principles

- **ALWAYS** write a unit test before implementing production code
- **ALWAYS** see the test fail before writing production code to satisfy it
- **NEVER** write more code than is necessary to make the tests pass
- **ALWAYS** commit code after tests pass
- **ALWAYS** ensure that all tests are passing before committing
