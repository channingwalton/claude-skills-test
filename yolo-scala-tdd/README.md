# Claude Skills and Agents Test Framework

This experiment uses Claude Code with a simple CLAUDE.md with TDD instructions.

Instead of feeding Claude with one task at a time, I asked it to implement the whole
[REQUIREMENTS](./REQUIREMENTS.md) on its own.

Its written in Scala 3 and built with SBT.

There are no corrections in this example, I wanted to have an example of what vibe coding
would produce.

See my observations [here](./LOG.md#observations).

Look at the commit history for files in this directory to see how Claude worked through the problem.

Claude's implementation commits: [150229c](https://github.com/channingwalton/claude-skills-test/commit/150229c)...[fcba115](https://github.com/channingwalton/claude-skills-test/commit/fcba115) ([compare](https://github.com/channingwalton/claude-skills-test/compare/150229c...fcba115))
