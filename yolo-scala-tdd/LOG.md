## Observations

- Claude started well: `Now I'll follow TDD - writing tests first, seeing them fail, then implementing. Let me start with Book and Library tests`
- Created a `LibrarySpec`
- Ran tests which did not compile because no prod code
- Claude: `Tests fail as expected. Now I'll write the minimal production code to make them pass`
- Used mutable collections
- Bad naming with `_` prefixes
- Ran the tests which passed
- Committed `Add Book and Library with basic add books feature`
- Basic loop seems to be working
- Proceeded to write several tests for title search
- Ran the tests - compilation failure as expected
- Implemented the code to make the test pass
- Tests pass - committing
- and so on
- The CLAUDE.md instructions need improvement because Claude was writing lots of tests at once
- Scala implementation is poor, not FP at all
- The `multiple copies` step made Claude realise it needed to restructure things
